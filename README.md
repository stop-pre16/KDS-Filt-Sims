# KDS-Filt-Sims
Simulated datasets and code needed to produce SNCP results in KDS-Filt paper

This repository contains the simulated datasets and scripts needed to recreate the simulation results in "Filtering Spatial Point Patterns Using Kernel Densities".

The scripts require the user to update the paths to the simulated datasets and results folders (need one for KDS-Filt and one for DBSCAN).
